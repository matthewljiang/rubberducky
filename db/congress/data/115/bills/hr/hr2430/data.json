User fees are eliminated for supplements to new drug applications and drug manufacturing facilities.\n\nMedical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017\n\nThe bill extends through FY2022 and revises FDA user fees for medical devices. A user fee is established for requests to classify devices that are not substantially equivalent to marketed devices. The FDA is no longer granted the discretion to waive or reduce fees in the interest of public health.\n\nThe FDA must establish a pilot program to accredit testing laboratories to determine whether medical devices conform to performance standards.\n\nThe bill revises the types of medical devices that the FDA may accredit third parties to review.\n\nGeneric Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017\n\nThe bill extends through FY2022 and revises FDA user fees for generic drugs. User fees are eliminated for supplements to generic drug applications. An annual fee is assessed on holders of approved generic drug applications.\n\nBiosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2017\n\nThe bill extends through FY2022 and revises FDA user fees for biosimilars. (Biosimilars are biological products approved by the FDA based on their similarity to an already-approved biological product.) User fees are eliminated for supplements to biosimilar applications and biosimilar manufacturing facilities. An annual fee is assessed on holders of approved applications for biosimilars. The bill sets the annual amount of revenue that must be generated by fees.\n\nThe bill extends through FY2022 programs and policies including Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships, support for development of medical products for rare conditions, and the program to conduct pediatric studies of drugs."

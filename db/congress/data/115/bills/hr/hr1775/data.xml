This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the President, with respect to offering one or more Medicare-operated prescription drug plan options, to: (1) negotiate prices&#160;with drug manufacturers, and (2) establish and apply a formulary and formulary incentives. In general, a Medicare-operated drug plan must meet the same requirements as apply to other prescription drug plans.

The President must report to Congress biannually on negotiations conducted by the President to achieve lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries.</summary>

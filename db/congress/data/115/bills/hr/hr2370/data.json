Santa Rosa County shall assume ownership of the non-federal land conveyed to it free of such restrictions.\n\n Santa Rosa County or any other person to whom such county reconveys such land may reconvey any part of it. Any proceeds from the conveyance of such land by either county shall be considered to be windfall profits that shall revert to the United States."

Urges the President to:\n\n persuade the government of South Sudan to stop blocking aid; notify Congress if that government does not immediately respect international humanitarian law; press the government of Nigeria to ensure accountability for security forces that violate human rights and fail to cooperate with international aid efforts; send a high level representative to the United Kingdom's Ministerial Conference on Somalia and publicly announce a contribution to the humanitarian assistance efforts; and work with stakeholders to persuade parties to conflict in Yemen to permit humanitarian groups increased access to Red Sea ports to deliver much-needed assistance."

The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nNational Clinical Care Commission Act\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) a National Clinical Care Commission to evaluate and make recommendations regarding improvements to the coordination and leveraging of federal programs related to complex metabolic or autoimmune diseases that result from issues related to insulin and represent a significant disease burden (e.g., diabetes). The commission must report on: (1) HHS programs that focus on prevention, (2) current activities and gaps in federal efforts to support clinicians in providing integrated care, (3) improvement in federal education and awareness activities related to prevention and treatment, and (4) methods for outreach and dissemination of education and awareness materials.\n\nThe commission must submit an operating plan to HHS and Congress within 90 days of its first meeting. The commission is terminated after it submits a final report, but not later than the end of FY2021."

 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit for up to $5,000 for the training of a qualified individual in a qualified apprenticeship program or a qualified multi-employer apprenticeship program. The bill defines a "qualified individual" as an individual who: (1) is an apprentice participating in a&#160;qualified apprenticeship program or a qualified multi-employer apprenticeship program, (2)&#160;has been employed in either program for a period of at least seven months that ends within the taxable year, and (3) is not a highly compensated employee or a seasonal worker.

 The bill defines "qualified apprenticeship program" as a program that: (1) provides qualified individuals with on-the-job training and instruction for a qualified occupation (i.e., a skilled trade occupation in a high-demand mechanical, technical, health care, or technology field); (2) is registered with the Office of Apprenticeship of the Department of Labor; and (3) maintains records relating to the qualified individual. A "qualified multi-employer apprenticeship program" is a program in which multiple employers are required to contribute and that is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements.

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a premature distribution, without penalty, from&#160;a tax-qualified retirement plan to an employee who is serving as a mentor. A "mentor" is defined as a working individual who: (1) has attained age 55; (2) works reduced hours and engages in mentoring activities for at least 20% of such hours; and (3) is responsible for the training and education of employees or students in an area of expertise for which such individual has a professional credential, certificate, or degree.</summary>

The bill amends the Small Business Act to require SBA development centers to provide, in conjunction with the IRS, informational materials, education, and basic training to small business concerns relating to federal income tax credits, including credits available to: (1) businesses generally; and (2) small business concerns and startups specifically, especially credits for research and experimentation.\n\nSuch materials, education, and basic training may be delivered in person or through an Internet website."

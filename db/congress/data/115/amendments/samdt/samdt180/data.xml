  <description>To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to strengthening Social Security and repealing and replacing Obamacare, which has increased health care costs, raised taxes on middle-class families, reduced access to high quality care, created disincentives for work, and caused tens of thousands of Americans to lose coverage they had and liked, and replacing it with reforms that strengthen Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the disabled or children and lead to patient-centered step-by-step health reforms that provide access to quality, affordable private health care coverage for all Americans and their families by increasing competition, State flexibility, and individual choice, and safe-guarding consumer protections that Americans support.</description>
